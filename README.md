# kdramawikiscrape
use python to read a file of watched dramas and their wiki links. Then use the links to scrape for the cast, director, writers etc. Return data about most watched actors, writers, producers etc. 

view the file dramas.csv for the example format. 

note of bugs / requirements: 

the code is written specifically for the common name lens for kdrama, and runs into issues with names like J'as'per or 'As'pen. Since these names are rare in Kdrama, I ignored it. If this were to be scaled up to work for western media, changes would need to be made.
